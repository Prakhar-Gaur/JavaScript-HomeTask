1 - Printing Array elements with Comma delimiters

Input: Array of elements

["h","o","l","a"]

Output: String with comma delimited elements of the array in th same order.

"h,o,l,a"



//solution//

function printArray(array){
  
  var res=array[0];
  for(var i=1;i<array.length;i++)
    {
      res = res + ','  + array[i];
    }
  return res;
}





2 - Opposite number

Very simple, given a number, find its opposite.


//solution//

function opposite(number) {
  
  return number*-1;
}



3 - Basic Mathematical Operations

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

//solution//

function basicOp(operation, value1, value2)
{
  // Code
  if(operation == '+')
    return value1+value2;
  if(operation=='-')
    return  value1 - value2;
  if(operation=='*')
    return  value1 * value2;
  if(operation=='/')
    return  value1 / value2;
  
}




4 - Transportation on vacation

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

//solution//

function rentalCarCost(d) {
  
let cost = d*40;
  if(d>=7)
    return cost - 50;
  if(d>=3)
  return cost-20;
  return cost;
}
